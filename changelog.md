# Update 2 out now for 1.19.2 AND 1.20.1!
Hey Hey! Okami here! Me and Max have been working really hard to get out this new update and its finally done! I'm the artist whos been making most of the sprites and from here on also going to be the writer of the changelogs so if there's ever something wrong with one of them blame me! :3

This time around we focused bigtime on features, optimization, and especially crafting! There is also plenty of new content and goals to achieve within the mod itself! starting off with...

## New Features
-  32 new cassettes!
- Advancements!
- Looping system
- Queue system
- Randomized error messages
- Remaining Time HUD (Toggleable)
- New Crafting Items (Elaborated on more in the Changes sub-section)

With these new features its sure to add to already existing collections alongside the quality of life that is looping and queueing!
Just put your favorite cassette in and listen to it for 100 hours with looping! Or if you'd like you can make an elaborate queue with your favorite soundtracks as well, and if you have both features enabled you can loop an entire queue!
Advancements are for those looking for a sense of purpose and satisfaction, we truly hope you enjoy the collect-a-thon style advancements for soundtracks from your favorite artists and series, with little rewards for those who do catch them- er collect them all!
Also Max got mad at me for putting bread in the Blockman.. DO NOT DO IT.
 
## New Versions
- 1.20.1 port
Currently as of this update going live 1.20.1 will also now have the mod! 
We hope to expand the mod to more versions as they come, but for now its going to be 1.19.2 and 1.20.1, If there is other versions youd like to ask about us porting to definitely let us know! This mod is for the people, and your (probably) people!

## Changes and Balance
- Agent Rainbow stacks up to 16
- Resprited: Bull Pill, How it seems to end, Blockman Buttons
- Huge Crafting Update

A big focus with this update was making crafting a bit more interesting and giving different cassettes unique new items that more fit them, as stated before this is new content, but alot of it is changes to existing recipes, not making them any much more expensive, just giving them the attention that they needed as unique crafting items have been planned since the start! All of the items are derived from different series or direct inspirations from songs and where they come from, and they go as follows..
- New Crafting Items Include:
- Knob (Roblox Doors)
- Joycon (Nintendo)
- Stolas' Grimoire (Helluva Boss)
- Yeezy's (why are they so ugly)
- Annoying Cassette (Undertale/Deltarune)
- Coffin Varnish (Lackadaisy)
- Violin (Omori)
- Turr√≥n (ENA)
- Gold Play Button (Youtube)
- Normal Pills (Will Wood)
- Remnant (FNaF)
- Auric Bar (Terraria Calamity)

I obviously wont list out every cassette and recipe change here but there is a lot! And most likely more to come!

## Optimization
- Performance fixes
- Bug fixes
- Removed Herobrine Cassette

Thats all for this update, on a serious note hitting 100 downloads meant alot to us, thank you all so so much for experiencing our mod and even leaving comments! Those mean alot to see that our mod is being appreciated at all. What once started as a silly mod for our groupchat being only 44 discs (not cassettes!) growing all the way into a fun little project like this is seriously sick and we both are so grateful from the bottom of our hearts. <3

We hope you stick around and remember! 

Don't forget to wind the music box!
